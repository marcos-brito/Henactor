# Customizing

One of the main goals of **Henactor** is to be completely customizable. Most, if not all,
things you see in the screen can be changed. The best way to do so is by using themes.

A theme is a combination of a _css_ file named `theme.css` and an optional file named
`icons.toml`. At startup **Henactor** will search for themes inside the `themes` directory
in your configuration. Each theme should be on it's own directory under `themes`.

> **Tip:** If you set the `Auto reload` option every change to the theme will be instantly
> reflected. You don't have to worry about restarting the application.

For more details in both theming files follow this links:

-   [CSS](./customizing/themes.md)
-   [Icons](./customizing/icons.md)

As a reminder, there a few things that can be easily changed under the `Settings -> Appeareance`.
