# Henactor

Henactor is a open source and highly customizable file explorer/manager. You should be able to change anything in anyway. The main
features are:

-   🎨 **Customization:** Problems with the looks? Change colors, fonts, icons, and even layouts using **css** or the UI itself
-   ⌨️ **Keybindings:** Hate your mouse? You don't need it. Bind anything to any key or use a familiar **vim** mode
-   🔄 **Live reload:** Changing your configuration from outside the app? See the changes **instantly**
-   ☁️ **Cloud storage:** Want to see your cloud storage? Easily manage them using the **rclone** integration

And a lot more. You can see all features [here]().
